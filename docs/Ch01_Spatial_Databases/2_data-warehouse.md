# Data Warehouse

A Data Warehouse (DW) is a relational database that is designed for **query and analysis** rather than transaction processing. It includes historical data derived from transaction data from single and multiple sources.
Data warehouse is essentially a collection of large amounts of historical data as well as a collection of **decision support** tools that can be integrated for decision support. In operational database applications all CRUD operations are performed on data whereas in data warehousing, warehouse loads data from operational system and can only be retrieved. Data is volatile in warehouse which means once data is loaded it can not be changed or deleted.

## Spatial Data warehouse:
Spatial data warehouse describes a collection of **geospatial data** to support spatially related business activities and decision making. It provides a common data model that integrates seamlessly both spatial and non-spatial data.
